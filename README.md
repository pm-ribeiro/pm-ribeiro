### Hi there 👋
My name is Patrícia. I’m a computer engineering student with a passion for front-end and digital design.

Currently, I'm enrolling in the last semester of computer engineering at the Federal University of Pelotas and working with computational linguistics.

Since 2018 I also work as a front-end web developer using mainly Vuejs, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#### I’m currently:
- 🔭 working as a front-end developer at [Melhor Envio](https://melhorenvio.com.br/)
- 🌱 learning Vue 3 and ReactJs
