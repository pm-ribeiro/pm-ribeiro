### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is PatrÃ­cia. Iâ€™m a computer engineering student with a passion for front-end and digital design.

Currently, I'm enrolling in the last semester of computer engineering at the Federal University of Pelotas and working with computational linguistics.

Since 2018 I also work as a front-end developer using mainly Vuejs, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
